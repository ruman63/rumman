[Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co) is a framework for building modern _static_ websites, using the similar tooling that powers [Laravel](https://laravel.com) application. It supports Blade templating (just as same as Laravel) along with the markdown, which is great for content-driven pages (like article, blog post, or documentation pages). Jigsaw makes it very simple to create a blade layout and fill it in with markdown. It makes use of [laravel-mix](https://github.com/jeffreyway/laravel-mix) to compile assets. ðŸ™‚

Let's [get started](#started) with our first static website built with jigsaw.
